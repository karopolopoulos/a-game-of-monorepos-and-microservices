A growing example of a monorepo structure

## Getting Started

You will want to install all your dependencies first by running:

```
npm run bootstrap
```

## Introduction

Give it a whirl by running the below from the root level. Let the rest speak for itself.

```
npm start
```

##### TODO

- proper README.md
- package versions
- hoisting so there is less duplication of dev dependencies
- integration with cloud
- CI/CD
- multi language (e.g. python)
- common infrastructure
- sharing outputs from different services
- other crazy things
